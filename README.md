# Chance's Homework
This is a repository of my homework for all of my university classes. Each folder is dedicated to a certain course, its labs, projects, and recitations if applicable.
Although it would proably be better to have separate repos for each class, I'd like to see how much percentage each coding language takes up to see which languages I have work with most frequently, and which I should practice more on.

## Courses Currently Taking:

### 14:332:221 Principles of Electrical Engineering I (C++)

### 14:332:231 Digital Logic Design (Verilog)

### 01:640:251 Multivariable Calculus

### 14:440:221 Engineering Mechanics - Statics
