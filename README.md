# Chance's Homework
This is a repository of my homework for all of my courses. Each folder is dedicated to a certain course, its labs, and recitations if applicable.
Although it would proably be better to have separate repos for each class, I'd like to see how much percentage each coding language takes up to see which languages I have worked with most frequently, and which I should practice more on.

## Classes taken so far:

### 01:198:111 Introduction to Computer Science (Java)

### 14:440:127 Introduction to Computers for Engineers (MATLAB)

### 14:332:221 Principles of Electrical Engineering I (C++)

### 14:332:231 Digital Logic Design (Verilog)
