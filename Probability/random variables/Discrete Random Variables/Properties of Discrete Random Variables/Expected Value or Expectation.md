The expected value or expectation $E(x)$ is the weighted average of all values the random variable $X$ can be. This is useful to see the weight of each value, due to the value being a large number, or being more probable than other value.

We find the expectation by summing all values $x_i$ multiplied by its probability $p(x_i)$ given by its [[Probability Mass Function]]. $X$ must take on values that have a probability greater than 1.

$$E(x) = \sum_{x=i}^n{x_ip(x_i)}$$

We can also take the expected value of functions $g(x)$. 

$$E[g(x)] = \sum_{x=i}^n{g(x_i)p(x_i)}$$
