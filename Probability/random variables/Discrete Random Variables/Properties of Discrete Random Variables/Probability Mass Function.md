A probability mass function (PMF) $p(x_i)$ is a function that gives the probability that $X$ will exactly take a specific value. We can write it as:

$$ p(x_i) = P\{X=x_i\}$$
Where $x_i$ is a countable number of values. This means that $X$ can take on different values $x_1, x_2, ... x_i$ for all values of $x_i$. The probability of $X$ not being a value $x_i$ is 0. Additionally, every probability  $p(x_i)$ all sum up to 1. A PMF can be visualized as a bar chart, with the x values displaying each $x_i$, and the y values displaying each $p(x_i)$.

Since a PMF usually gives multiple probabilities, we can write out each entry as:

$$
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		P\{X=0\} & = p(x_0) \\
		P\{X=1\} & = p(x_1) \\ 
		P\{X=2\} & = p(x_2) \\
		..... \\
		P\{X=x_i\} & = p(x_i)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

$x_i$ does not necessarily have to increment, it can represent any number, such as the number of dots on a die, or number of errors made by a machine.
