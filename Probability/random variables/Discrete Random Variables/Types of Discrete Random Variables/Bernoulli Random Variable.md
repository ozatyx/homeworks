Bernoulli [[Random Variables]] are [[Discrete Random Variables]] which have only two outcomes: success or failure, 0 or 1, etc. 

Since there are only 2 outcomes, and the sum of any amount of outcomes is 1, we can set one outcome (usually the success, or favorable outcome) as $p$, and the other outcome is easily found as $1-p$. Formally, we can write its [[Probability Mass Function]] as: 

$$
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		p(0) = P\{X=0\} = 1-p \\
		p(1) = P\{X=1\} = p 
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$


A Bernoulli R.V.'s [[Expected Value or Expectation]] is just $p(1) = p$, since the formula for expectation sets p(0) to 0.

A Berenoulli R.V.'s [[Variance]] is:

$$p(1-p)$$
