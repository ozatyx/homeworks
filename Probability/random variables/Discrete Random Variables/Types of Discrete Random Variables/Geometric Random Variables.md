Geometric [[Random Variables]] are [[Discrete Random Variables]] that describe the probability of a number of trials required for a success. In other words, given a number of trials, the geometric distribution gives the probability that a success will happen after those trials.

A geometric R.V.'s [[Probability Mass Function]] is given as:

$$P\{X=n\} = (1-p)^{n-1} \quad n = 1,2,...$$

Where $X$ is the number of trials, and $n$ is the last trial, or when the trial is a success.

A geometric R.V.'s [[Expected Value or Expectation]] and [[Variance]] is:

$$
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		E[X] & = \frac{1}{p}\\
		Var[X] & = \frac{1-p}{p^2}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$
